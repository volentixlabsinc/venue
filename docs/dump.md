Venue is a bounty program.


What is a bounty:
Bounty is a small task that is verified and renumerated.

A way to decentralize your employer.... Greg quote... new Gig economy.

Venue should be bigger than Volentix.

First platform is web based and not Verto... potential for plugin later.

++ Biggest issue is the changing business plan. Do we take fees for the bounty system.
    Need a business plan.
    The drop of price for steem
    Didn't have reach... only other members are reading it.
    Stable coin? DigitalGold
    Not able to have an escrow if payment is not available until the end.
